# ImageClassification-MobileNet

MobileNet is a type of convolutional neural network designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. They are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions to build lightweight deep neural networks that can have low latency for mobile and embedded devices.

We Used Mobile Net Model on Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset to predict the correct denotions of the numbers through the images of hands representing those numbers in sign language.
We removed some of the layers of the Mobile Net Model and added ours for the required output. And too changing the learnable parameters and training on the particular layers and hence representing the output through the confusion matrix.
